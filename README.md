# Fate-Summoner

DISCLAIMER: All Class Icons and Servant Arts are the property of DelightWorks, Aniplex and Kinoko Nasu.

The purpose of this application is to assist those who wish to run a Fate Grand Order based Dungeons and Dragons campaign with a visual GUI. 

It keeps track of all Servants already summoned and claimed so that they do not appear again upon rolling.

This application was coded by me. The Graphic assets were created by Andrew Cha.
